### Why Maintenance Windows Are Important
Whenever we have any scheduled maintenance activity, it is important to create a maintenance window in Dynatrace to suppress unnecessary alerts and problem notifications. This helps avoid confusion for other users and teams.

### Steps to Add Maintenance Window in Dynatrace

1. **Navigate to Settings**
   - From the Dynatrace dashboard, go to **Settings**.

2. **Open Maintenance Windows**
   - In the settings menu, navigate to **Monitoring > Alerting and Availability > Maintenance windows**.

3. **Add a Maintenance Window**
   - Click on **Add maintenance window**.

4. **Fill in Basic Details**
   - **Name**: Enter a name for your maintenance window, e.g., `Windows Patching`.
   - **Description**: Provide helpful information so that other users can understand the purpose of the maintenance window.

5. **Select Maintenance Type**
   - Choose whether it is a **Planned** or **Unplanned** maintenance.
   - For scheduled tasks, select **Planned**.

6. **Alerting Options**
   - Choose from the dropdown:
     - `Detect problems but don't alert`
     - `Disable problem detection during maintenance`
   - Recommended: **Detect problems but don't alert** â€“ This ensures Dynatrace does not alert users for issues expected during maintenance.

7. **Synthetic Monitors Execution**
   - You can disable synthetic monitor execution during this time by checking the relevant option.
   - This prevents alerts from synthetic monitors during maintenance.

8. **Set Schedule**
   - Choose the recurrence (e.g., Once, Daily, Weekly, Monthly).
   - Select the **Start Time** and **End Time**. Example:
     - Start: Tomorrow, 2:00 AM
     - Duration: 4 hours
   - Select the appropriate **Time Zone**.

9. **Add Filters (Optional)**
   - You can apply filters to target specific services, entities, or hosts.

10. **Save Changes**
   - Click on **Save Changes** to create the maintenance window.

### Summary
Once this window is active, if any server or application goes down, Dynatrace will not send alerts or generate problem notifications during the scheduled maintenance timeframe. This ensures clarity and avoids unnecessary confusion for your operations or security teams.
